                        : This is my first map for zdoom.  I tried out a lot of new features
                        : that were not available when I made maps in the days of DOS and modems.

                        : It plays in a traditional doom way, without mouselook.  
                        : GZDoom and hardware acceleration recommended, though it should work in zdoom 2.8.1 
                        : with slowdowns in some areas.
